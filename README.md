# Overview
This runs at xxxx.com, it is a client side web app to teach some of the edgecases of SQL.

I made it to learn more about SQLite and React.

# Design:
Sends a SQLite database to the client. This allows a user to insert / modify / drop the database as much as they want to without it effecting the server.
